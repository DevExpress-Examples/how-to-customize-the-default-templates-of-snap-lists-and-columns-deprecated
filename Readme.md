# How to use SnapDocument events to customize the default templates of Snap lists and columns

> **Note**
>
> As you may already know, the [WinForms Snap control](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/11373/controls-and-libraries/snap) and [Snap Report API](https://docs.devexpress.com/OfficeFileAPI/15188/snap-report-api) are now in maintenance support mode. No new features or capabilities are incorporated into these products. We recommend that you use [DevExpress Reporting](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/2162/reporting) tool to generate, edit, print, and export your business reports/documents.

This example illustrates how you can use the [SnapDocument](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.Snap.Core.API.SnapDocument?v=21.2) events to customize the structure and formatting of Snap lists and columns added to a document via the Data Explorer.

To learn more about using the Snap API, see [Developer Guidelines](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/16062/controls-and-libraries/snap/developer-guidelines?v=21.2).
